## 🛠️ Philosophy

1.  **Open Source Core:** We believe essential tooling should be open, transparent, and free.
2.  **No Vendor Lock-in:** Our plugins are designed to be portable. If you leave, you take your data.
3.  **Developer Experience (DX):** CLI commands, detailed documentation, and hooks for everything.
